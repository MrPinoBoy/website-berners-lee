# Mockup Exercise
## About this project
Hello! If you stumbled upon this project you are either one of my coaches (Hello [Nick](https://github.com/NickBanken) and [Tanya](https://github.com/Tanya-Amber-L) !), one of my workmates (Hello Hamiltons !), or you've lost yourself on the web. Either way, this is an exercise given by the [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg) organisation to learn more about **HTML** and **CSS** and introduce us to **mockup designs**. The website is about [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), **the creator of the World-Wide Web**.

## Goal of the exercise
- Recreate a simple website layout and design from two screenshots.
- Make it responsive.
## Lets get started !
### First: **HTML**

They are pretty much the same. I used **tables** for the movie list to get the same result, but I'm not sure if it was the *best* way of doing it. But hey, it works !

Otherwise, I used [**semantic HTML**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) to make it as accessible as possible.

### Next: **CSS**

CSS took me a bit more time. We had to implement the font [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) which I later realised -unless I failed that part- isn't the same font used in the screenshot. I didn't find how to make Mr Berners-Lee's picture *perfectly rounded* without using set pixel dimensions, so on my version it is slightly oval. The icons for the social medias are imported using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Is it **responsive**?
I played a bit with the responsive versions trying to figure out what was a good idea and what wasn't. I think the result is decent, even though the CSS is pretty messy.

## Conclusion
I enjoyed this exercise and managed to get a decent result. There is something therapeutic about fiddling with the CSS and managing to get the same result as the source :). I'm still struggling with the different display modes and how to lay things out correctly on the page using CSS, I need a lot of trial and error to get to what I want. But otherwise I had a great time and am proud of what I achieved :).

Thanks for checking out my work, if you want you can see more of my stuff on [my github](https://github.com/MrPinoBoy) !
